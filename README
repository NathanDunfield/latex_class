Using as a Mercurial subproject:

* Initial setup:

  hg clone ~/work/tex/pkgs/nmd 
  echo "nmd = ~/work/tex/pkgs/nmd" > .hgsub 
  hg add .hgsub
  hg commit -m "Added nmd subrepository"

* Usage: 

 To see status of the subproject: 
  
  hg status --subrepo

 Commits automatically check inside the subrepo, but need to push 
 and pull changes manually.
