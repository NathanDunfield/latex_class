\textbf{Background knowledge:} For the basics of topology, linear algebra, and
calculus which are assumed in these problems, see Appendices A, B, and
C of Lee's \emph{Introduction to Smooth Manifolds}.

\textbf{Homework policy:} Late homework will not be accepted; however, your lowest
two homework grades will be dropped so you are effectively allowed two
infinitely late assignments. Collaboration on homework is permitted,
nay encouraged, but you must write up your solutions individually and
understand them completely.
\begin{problems}
  \item Let $X$ be the set of all points $(x, y) \in \R^2$ where $y =
    \pm 1$, and let $M$ be the quotient of $X$ by the equivalence relation
    $(x, -1) \sim (x, 1)$ for $x > 0$.   
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Show that $M$ is locally Euclidean but is not a Hausdorff
        topological space.
      \item While (a) implies that $M$ is not a topological manifold
        as defined in class, are there still coordinate charts forming
        a smooth atlas on $M$?
    \end{enumerate}

\item Exercise 7 of Chapter 1 of Lee, which is on page 30.  

\item Exercise 8 of Chapter 1 of Lee, which is on page 31.  

\item Use the chain rule to show that if $\phi \maps \R^m \to \R^n$ is
  a diffeomorphism, then $m = n$.  Use this to prove that if smooth
  manifolds $M$ and $N$ are diffeomorphic then $\dim M = \dim N$.  

\item Consider the 2-dimensional torus $T$ in $\R^3$ shown below,
  where the inner radius is 2 and the outer radius is 4 and hence each
  vertical circle has radius 1.  Alternatively, $T$ is the surface of
  revolution given by spinning the circle $(x - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1$ about
  the $z$-axis. Give an explicit smooth atlas of charts for $T$
  exhibiting it as a 2-manifold.
